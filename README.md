# searching and sorting


Welcome to the Searching---Sorting repository! This collection of C++ code provides implementations for various searching and sorting algorithms. Whether you're a student looking to understand fundamental algorithms or a developer seeking reliable reference implementations, this repository aims to be a helpful resource.

Searching Algorithms

* Binary Search:

A logarithmic search algorithm for finding the position of a target element in a sorted array.

* Linear Search:

A basic searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.

* Sorting Algorithms

i) Bubble Sort:

A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

ii) Quick Sort:

An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into smaller sub-arrays.
Each algorithm is implemented in C++ for clarity and readability. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and understanding these algorithms, and the repository is open to contributions, suggestions, and improvements.
